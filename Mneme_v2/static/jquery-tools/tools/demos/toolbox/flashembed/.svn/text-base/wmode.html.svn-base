<%-- :mode=jsp: --%>
<%@ include file="../../header.jsf" %>



<p>
	It is possible to place HTML elements in front of the Flash movies to prevent the Flash from showing through. This is achieved by setting the <samp>wmode</samp> property to <samp>opaque</samp>. Then the Flash object can accept placement and positioning like any other element including the the <samp>z-index</samp> CSS property. Here is an example:
</p>

<%@ include file="wmode.htm" %>

<p>
	This feature does not work on Linux and in early versions of Opera, but browser support is still quite good.

<h3>JavaScript setup</h3>

<p>
	This is our JavaScript setup:
</p>

<pii:code>
${js}

	You can find a standalone version of this example <a href="wmode.htm">here</a>.
