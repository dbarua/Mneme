	<strong>Click on the ball</strong> to see a highly visual exposing experience! The background image can really make a difference.

<h3>Mask styling</h3>

<p>
	Our mask has a custom background color and image. It is horizontally centered and vertically positioned so that it will match the center of the exposed ball. By default the tool uses the id <samp>mask</samp>.
</p>

<pii:code lang="css">
${css}
</pii:code>

<p>
	The background image is a JPG image with a fixed background color. In the <a href="${jqt}/toolbox/expose.html#graphics">expose graphics zip</a> we also have a PNG version of the "star" which can be used together with any background color. Of course the PNG version has a much larger file size because it has alpha transparency.
</p>

<h3>HTML coding</h3>

<p>
	The ball is centered and its initial width has been shrunken a bit. Its original width is 298 pixels.
</p>

<pii:code lang="html">
${html}
</pii:code>

<h3>JavaScript coding</h3>

<p>
	Here we set up exposing for the ball image. We have two callback functions that perform the growing/shrinking animation. The <samp>click</samp> event is a normal jQuery event and inside that you'll get the handle to the <a href="${jqt}/toolbox/expose.html">exposing API</a> with <samp>$(this).expose().load();</samp>.
</p>

<p>
	The document height is larger after the ball size has grown. We use the <samp>fit()</samp> method to resize the mask to fill the whole document after the ball has been resized.
