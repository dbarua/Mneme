	Here we have customized the mask with a logo. Click on the video and you can see it above the video. We have also customized the close effect on the expose by giving it a fierce magenta colored "flash" effect. Click on the following video and wait for it to finish (or press the ESC key).

<h3>CSS code</h3>

<p>
	By default, the Expose tool uses the <samp>id</samp> "exposeMask" for the mask. You can customize it by simply adjusting its CSS properties. Here are our customizations for this demo:
</p>

<pii:code lang="css">
${css}
</pii:code>

<h3>HTML code</h3>

<p>
	This time we are exposing our video player and this is the only relevant HTML code. The player is surrounded with an additional box that is styled with a black background color and gradient. The styling is, of course, done with CSS:
</p>

<pii:code lang="html">${html}</pii:code>

<h3>The configuration</h3>

<p>
	We have tweaked quite a few of the configuration variables and each one is commented. We have also set two callback functions <samp>onBeforeClose</samp> and <samp>onBeforeLoad</samp> to achieve the magenta colored "flash" effect when the exposing closes. Note that the player is paused when the exposing is closed. Upon construction, the <a href="${jqt}/toolbox/expose.html#api">expose API</a> is returned by enabling the <samp>api</samp> variable. We use this variable in the Flowplayer configuration below:
</p>

<p>
	Here we call the <samp>load</samp> and <samp>close</samp> methods of the Expose API at the proper places:
</p>

<pii:code>${js}</pii:code>
