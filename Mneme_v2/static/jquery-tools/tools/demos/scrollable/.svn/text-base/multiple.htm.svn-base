<h2>Another instance</h2>

<p>
	In the previous JavaScript code we used a jQuery selector <samp>div.scrollable</samp> which selected all <samp>DIV</samp>s that have "scrollable" as their class name. So if we add a second, identical block of HTML here, then it will also work as a scrollable without any additional JavaScript coding.
</p>

<pii:code lang="html" embed="true">
${html}
</pii:code>

<h2>Custom click handler</h2>

<p>
	In this second scrollable you will notice a slight fadeOut/fadeIn effect when a single item is clicked. This is an example of adding a custom click action to an item. You'll use "standard" jQuery event handling for that. Here we add a custom handler to this second scrollable:
</p>

<pii:code embed="true">
$(function() {
	/* execute this script block when the page's Document Object Model has been loaded */

	// select items under the second scrollable and do something when they are clicked
	$("div.scrollable:eq(1) div.items div").click(function() {

		// perform the effect
		$(this).fadeOut().fadeIn();

	});
});
</pii:code>
