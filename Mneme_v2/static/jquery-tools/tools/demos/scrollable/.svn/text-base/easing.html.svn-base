<p>
	It is possible to alter scrollable's animation style or so-called "easing". Scroll through the following items and you can see it in action:
</p>

<div style="margin:20px -15px">
<%@ include file="easing.htm" %>
</div>

<br clear="all" />

<h3>Custom animation</h3>

<p>
	You can add new animations to the scrollable by adding them to the <samp>jQuery.easing</samp> object. Here we add one animation called "custom":
</p>

<pii:code>
${easing}
</pii:code>

<p>
	As you can see the animation code is not for sane people. I grabbed this function from the <a href="http://gsgd.co.uk/sandbox/jquery/easing/" class="external">jQuery Easing Plugin</a>'s <a href="http://gsgd.co.uk/sandbox/jquery/easing/jquery.easing.1.3.js" class="external">source code</a>. There are quite a lot of different algorithms that you can try. This same library is being used by the jQuery UI project as well.
</p>

<h3>Scrollable setup</h3>

<p>
	The scrollable setup is simple. You configure the custom easing with the <samp>easing</samp> property. We can also change the easing speed with the <samp>speed</samp> property. Here we made it a little slower so that the animation is more visible.
</p>

<pii:code>
${js}
</pii:code>

	Take a look at a <a href="easing.htm">standalone version</a> of this demo. View its source code to get things going on your page.
</div>

<h3>Changing the easing of an existing scrollable</h3>

<p>
	You can dynamically change the easing settings for an existing scrollable:
</p>

<pii:code>
// get handle to the configuration
var conf = $("#tab_panes").scrollable().getConf();

// alter the easing
conf.easing = 'custom';
conf.speed = 700;
</pii:code>
