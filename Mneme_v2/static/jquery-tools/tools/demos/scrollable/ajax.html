	Below is a scrollable similar to the <a href="navigation.html">navigation demo</a> and below that is a button that loads a new set of items to scrollable. This kind of setup is suitable for pages that have scrollable items that change dynamically.

<%@ include file="ajax.htm" %>

<p>
	New items are located in the external page <a href="ajax-items.htm">ajax-items.htm</a> and they are loaded with jQuery's <samp>load</samp> method. Note that the number of items is greater so there will be more entries in the navigator element.

<pii:code lang="html">
