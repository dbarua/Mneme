<p>
	This demo shows that it's no different to make a more visually appealing scrollable than the one in the <a href="index.html">minimal setup</a>. Here we have placed the same navigational elements as in the <a href="navigation.html">previous demo</a> and we have tweaked the looks of a single item inside scrollable.
</p>


<%@ include file="visual.htm" %>

<h3>HTML code</h3>

<p>
	Here is our HTML structure. It's almost the same as before except that the items that are scrolled have more data inside them than just a single number as in our other examples.
</p>

<pii:code lang="html">
<!-- root element -->
<div class="scrollable">

	<!-- we have different kind of container for items for a change -->
	<div id="thumbs">

		<!-- one item. in the example we have many of these -->
		<div>

			<img src="/img/demos/photos/thumbX.jpg" />

			<h3><em>X. </em>An example title</h3>

			<p>
				Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Proin et felis eget
				tellus pharetra porttitor. Praesent dui arcu, egestas quis, adipiscing a.
			</p>

			<span>XX sec</span>

		</div>

	</div>

</div>
</pii:code>

<h3>CSS code</h3>

<p>
	Here we present just the styling of single item. The whole CSS setup can be seen by looking at the sources from our <a href="visual.htm">standalone page</a>.
</p>

<pii:code lang="css">
${css}
</pii:code>


<h3>JavaScript code</h3>

<p>
	We have three items visible at once so we must set the <samp>size<samp> property to 3. We are using a different container for the items than the default ".items" so we need a custom setting for the <samp>items</samp> property. By defining the <samp>hoverClass</samp> property we can define the custom style for the item when the mouse is placed over it. See the <samp>#thumbs div.hover</samp> setting from the CSS section above.
