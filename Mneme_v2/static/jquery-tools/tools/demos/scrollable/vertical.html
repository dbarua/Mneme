<p>
	Here we show you a vertical setup for a scrollable. There is a minor change compared to the <a href="index.html">minimal setup</a> and it's recommended that you study that first before continuing. This scrollable has 4 elements in total and each element has 3 rows that are shown at a time. You can scroll these elements by:
</p>

<ol>
	<li>Clicking on the "more pictures" link.</li>
	<li>Using the up and down arrow keys.</li>
	<li>Using your mousewheel.</li>
</ol>

<%@ include file="vertical.htm" %>

<h3>HTML code</h3>

<p>
	Our HTML structure is identical to the one presented in the "minimal setup" except that the items that are scrolled are more complex than just a single image. Also, the navigational buttons have been placed inside a wrapping <samp>DIV</samp>.
</p>

<pii:code lang="html">
<div id="actions">
   <a class="prev">&laquo; Back</a>
   <a class="next">More pictures &raquo;</a>
</div>

<!-- root element for scrollable -->
<div class="scrollable vertical">

   <!-- root element for the scrollable elements -->
   <div class="items">

      <!-- first element. contains three rows -->
      <div>

         <!-- first row -->
         <div class="item">

            <!-- image -->
            <img src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/${img}_m.jpg" />

            <!-- title -->
            <h3>1. Barcelona Pavilion</h3>

            <!-- content -->
            <p>
               The Pavilion was not only a pioneer ...
            </p>

         </div>

         <!-- 2:nd and 3:rd rows -->
         <div class="item"> ... </div>
         <div class="item"> ... </div>

      </div>

      <!-- second element with another three rows (and so on) -->
      <div>
         ...
      </div>

   </div>

</div>
</pii:code>

<h3>CSS code</h3>

<p>
	We have used the following <a href="${jqt}/css/scrollable-vertical.css">CSS file</a> for the above setup. Here are the crucial parts from the CSS file that are required for a vertical scrollable:
</p>

<pii:code lang="css">
/* root element for scrollable */
.scrollable {

	/* required settings */
	position:relative;
	overflow:hidden;

	/* vertical scrollables have typically larger height than width but not now */
	height: 665px;
	width: 700px;
}

/* root element for scrollable items */
.scrollable .items {
	position:absolute;

	/* this time we have very large space for the height */
	height:20000em;
}
</pii:code>

<p>
	<strong>Note:</strong> in a horizontal scrollable the items are floating side by side by using the <samp>float: left</samp> property. In vertical scrollables this is not necessary.
</p>

<h3>JavaScript code</h3>

<p>
	The scrollable is good at guessing whether its vertical or horizontal by investigating it's width and height. If the height is larger than width then the scrollable is vertical. This can also be manually configured with the <samp>vertical</samp> property which overrides the automatic determination.
</p>

<p>
	We use the <samp>mousewheel</samp> configuration to enable scrolling with the mousewheel. You need to make sure that <a href="${jqt}/toolbox/mousewheel.html">mousewheel tool</a> is included on your page.
</p>

<pii:code>${js}</pii:code>

<p>
	<strong>Note:</strong> this mousewheel tool is not included in the standard jQuery Tools distribution. You must download a <a href="${jqt}/download/index.html#combine">custom combination</a> that includes this tool.
</p>
