<p>
	You can load the page so that a specific tab is initially opened. This happens by naming the tabs and opening the page so that the name is given in the URL's anchor. When this page is opened, the second tab is initially opened. Look for the URL which has the anchor <samp>#second</samp>.
</p>

<%@ include file="anchors.htm" %>

<p>
	As you can see, the panes have regular anchor links. If those anchor links match the names of the tabs, those tabs are automatically opened.
</p>

<h3>HTML coding</h3>

<p>
	Look for the tab names in the <samp>href</samp> attribute and those links inside the panes:
</p>

<pii:code lang="html">
${html}
</pii:code>

<h3>JavaScript coding</h3>

<p>
	Tab construction is identical to the <a href="index.html">minimal setup</a>. There is nothing special here.
</p>

<pii:code>
${js}
</pii:code>
