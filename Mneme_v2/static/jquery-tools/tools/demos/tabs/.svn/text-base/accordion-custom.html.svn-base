	This demo shows how you can add custom effects to tabs. Here you can see a slight background color change when the sliding effect occurs:

<h3>Adding a custom effect</h3>

<p>
	If you want to make custom effects, you'll use the <samp>$.tools.tabs.addEffect()</samp> method. The first argument is the effect name and the second argument is the function that performs the required functionality when a tab (or accordion header) is clicked. You can use this method to modify existing effects or add new ones. Here we modify the built-in "slide" effect:
</p>

<pii:code>
${effect}
</pii:code>

<p>
	Your effect function is given two arguments. The first argument, <samp>i</samp>, refers to the tab index number and the second argument, <samp>done</samp>, is a function that you <em>must call</em> after your effect finishes its job. This can be accomplished by calling <samp>done.call();</samp> .
</p>

<h3>JavaScript coding</h3>

<p>
	After we have modified our effect, the accordion installation is identical to our <a href="accordion.html">basic installation</a>:
</p>

<pii:code>
${js}
</pii:code>
