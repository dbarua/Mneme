	jQuery Tools / Mousewheel - Take control of your mousewheel
</h1>

<h2 class="first">Usage</h2>

<p>
	The Mousewheel plugin allows you to take control of the mousewheel. For example:
</p>

<pii:code>
// make #myelement listen for mousewheel events
$("#myelement").mousewheel(function(event, delta) {

});
</pii:code>

<p>
	Whenever the mousewheel is used while the mouse point is over the elements specified by the jQuery selector, the supplied callback function is called. It takes two arguments. The first one is the jQuery <a href="http://docs.jquery.com/Event" class="external">event object</a> and the second argument specifies how much the wheel was rotated. A positive value for <samp>delta</samp> means movement downwards and a negative value means movement upwards.
</p>

	This plugin is based on Three Dub Media's <a href="http://plugins.jquery.com/project/wheel">wheel plugin</a> which is a smaller, simplified interpretation of the Brandon Aaron's well-known special event, "Mouse Wheel Extension". Thanks.
