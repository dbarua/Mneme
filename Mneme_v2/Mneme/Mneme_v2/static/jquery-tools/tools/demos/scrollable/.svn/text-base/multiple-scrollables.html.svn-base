	Here is another innovative way of scrolling images. Click on the images to see it in action. Use the <strong>left/right keys</strong> to navigate between images within a single scrollable:

<div style="margin:20px -20px">

</div>

<h3>HTML coding</h3>

<p>
	Here is a setup for a single scrollable. You can have as many of these on your page as you want.
</p>

<pii:code lang="html">
<!-- scroll #1 -->
<div class="scroll">
	<div class="pics">
		<div style="background-image:url(my-image-01.jpg)"></div>
		<div style="background-image:url(my-image-02.jpg)"></div>
		<div style="background-image:url(my-image-03.jpg)"></div>
	</div>
</div>
</pii:code>

<h3>CSS coding</h3>

<p>
	Here is our CSS code. Nothing really special here. Scrollables are placed side by side with the <samp>float: left</samp> setting. We have a separate CSS block for the activated scrollable item that can be styled.
</p>

<pii:code lang="css">
${css}
</pii:code>

<h3>JavaScript coding</h3>

<p>
	Here we enable our scrollables. All scrollables have the <samp>circular</samp> configuration option set to <samp>true</samp> so that there is no beginning or end. We also add a custom click handler which seeks the scrollable forward using the <samp>next()</samp> method of the <a href="${jqt}/scrollable/index.html#api">Scrollable API</a>.
</p>

${js}
