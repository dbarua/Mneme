<p>
	This demo uses <samp>interval</samp> configuration option to make those items scroll automatically within 2 second interval. When placing your mouse over the items scrolling is paused. When all 15 items have been scrolled it starts from the beginning. This is achieved with <samp>loop</samp> parameter. This kind of system can be used in product catalogues for example.

<p>
	You can also see a little fadeOut/fadeIn effect on the items when they are moved.
</p>

<h3>JavaScript setup</h3>

<p>
	Here is our JavaScript configuration. We use callback events <samp>onBeforeSeek</samp> and <samp>onSeek</samp> to achieve the fading animation.
