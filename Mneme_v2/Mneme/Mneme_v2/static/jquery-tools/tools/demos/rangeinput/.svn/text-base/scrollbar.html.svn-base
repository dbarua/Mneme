	You can use the rangeinput to control other elements too. Here we use it to control scrolling of a DIV. A little more coding and you can present your products like Apple does.
</p>

<%@ include file="scrollbar.htm" %>

<h3>HTML coding</h3>

<p>
	We set the range's maximum value to <samp>2600</samp> with the <samp>max</samp> attribute. This is the same as the width of the scollable area. The <samp>step</samp> attribute specifies the size of an individual animation step. Having a value here makes the sliding a bit faster.
</p>

<pii:code lang="html">
${html}
</pii:code>


<h3>Rangeinput initialization</h3>

<p>
	We use the <samp>onSlide</samp> and <samp>change</samp> events to control the sliding of the DIV as follows:
</p>

<pii:code>
${js}
</pii:code>

<p>
	You need to place the <samp>script</samp> block <em>after</em> the HTML code or you can alternatively use jQuery's <samp>$(document).ready</samp> to execute the script as soon as the webpage's Document Object Model (DOM) has been loaded. Read more about that from the <a href="${jqt}/documentation/basics.html#document_ready">User's Manual</a>.
</p>

<h3>CSS coding</h3>

<p>
	We use this documented <a href="css/scrollbar.css">CSS file</a> for styling the scrollbar and the slider. The CSS logic is the same as when implementing jQuery Tools <a href="${jqt}/scrollable/index.html">scrollables</a>.
