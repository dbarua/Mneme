<h3>Initialization</h3>

<p>
	The tool is smart enough to realize that these ranges are vertical by inspecting their dimensions. The <samp>progress</samp> option enables the yellow progressbar which is styled with CSS. The <samp>max</samp> option specifies the maximum value which is being overridden by the individual ranges.

<h3>HTML coding</h3>

<p>
	Here are the rangeinput elements. The shared configuration options are overridden with the HTML5 <samp>min</samp>, <samp>max</samp>, <samp>step</samp> and <samp>value</samp> attributes. See the <a href="${jqt}/rangeinput/#configuration">rangeinput configuration</a> for the descriptions and default values of these options.
