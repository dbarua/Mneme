<%-- :mode=jsp: --%>
<%@ include file="../../header.jsf" %>



<p>
	Many times it's good practice to defer loading of the Flash object until the user clicks on the Flash container. This makes the page load faster, especially if the Flash component is large. Here we have an example:
</p>

<%@ include file="onclick1.htm" %>

<h3>The setup</h3>

<p>
	This is our HTML/JavaScript setup. You can find a standalone version <a href="onclick1.htm">here</a> which includes the CSS settings for the container.
</p>

<pii:code lang="html">
${html}
</pii:code>

<h2>Same with jQuery</h2>

<p>
	The above example uses traditional event binding using the <samp>onClick</samp> event listener. Some users don't like this because it allows you to bind only one event listener for the element. For this reason, we have a jQuery example of this same scenario:
</p>

<%@ include file="onclick2.htm" %>

<p>
	We have set a background image for the container and the <samp>H2</samp> title has been replaced with a play button.
</p>

<pii:code>
${js}
</pii:code>

<p>
	You can find a standalone version of this jQuery example <a href="onclick2.htm">here</a>.
